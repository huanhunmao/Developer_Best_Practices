// Why TypeScript?
// TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding static types. Benefits include:

// Early Error Detection: TypeScript identifies errors during compilation, reducing runtime errors.
// Code Readability: Type annotations make the code more understandable.
// Easier Refactoring: Safe and predictable code modifications.
// Richer IDE Support: Better autocompletion, navigation, and hints.
