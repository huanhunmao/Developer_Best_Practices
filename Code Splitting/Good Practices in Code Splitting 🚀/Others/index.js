// Component Styles: Define styles in separate CSS or SCSS files, or use CSS-in-JS styled components.

// API Calls: Separate API call functions into a dedicated service or API layer.

// Contexts and Hooks: Define React contexts and custom hooks in their own files. 
// Conclusion Adopting a modular code structure by splitting your code into logical and coherent units not only enhances readability
//  and maintainability but also prevents conflicts and encourages code reuse. This approach is essential in collaborative environments 
// and large-scale applications.
