 In simple terms, here is the overall order of imports style guide:

 core packages (e.g. React, React Router, Next, etc…)
 assets (e.g. images, SVGs, icons, etc…)
 component/shared ui/sub pages
 third-party packages
 configuration files/utils/types/validation schema/hooks/custom hooks/sate management
 api functions/services
